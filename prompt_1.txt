User: Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
\"{}\"
To accomplish this, think carefully and write a short, one-sentence approach for attacking the problem. 
Then use a sympy-based approach and implement it in python code, surrounded by a ```python{{code}}``` block. 
Refine your approach and iterate until you are confident of an answer. Put your final numerical answer within \\boxed{{}}\\. 
Note: While the intermediate outputs may be real numbers, the final answer is always a numerical value."""
